# Papilotte

Papilotte is a flexible and extensible server which implements the [IPIF API](https://github.com/GVogeler/prosopogrAPhI).

The server is currently being developed as a tool for testing the API. Once the IPIF API is stable, 
Papilotte can be used as a stand-alone server with integrated database or as a frontend or proxy to 
existing prosopographic resources to provide them via the IPIF interface.
